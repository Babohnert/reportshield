OUTPUT RULES – Compliance Audit (v2.9)

FORMAT:
- Output must be plain text only.
- Exactly five labeled sections, in this order:
  [SECTION 1] REPORT METADATA SNAPSHOT
  [SECTION 2] SUMMARY OF COMPLIANCE FLAGS
  [SECTION 3] DETAILED FLAGS AND REFERENCES
  [SECTION 4] TOP FLAGS (CONDENSED)
  [SECTION 5] ADDITIONAL NOTES
- No markdown, emojis, tables, or styling. Use "→" bullets only.

MANDATORY FLAGS TO CHECK:
- 1004MC (Market Conditions Addendum) presence (any of: “1004MC”, “Form 1004MC”, “Market Conditions Addendum”, “Market Conditions (1004MC)”).
- VA evidence when VA loan indicated (any of: “MPR”, “Minimum Property Requirements”, “Tidewater”, “Notice of Value”, “NOV”).
- Signature/date basic consistency (effective date vs. inspection date if both present).

CONTENT RULES:
- SECTION 1 lists: file name, effective date (+ evidence), form type (+ evidence), appraiser name, intended use/client, loan type, VA indicator, and value conclusion if present.
- SECTION 2: one line per high-level flag with severity.
- SECTION 3: mirror SECTION 2 flags; include a short, redacted evidence snippet when available.
- SECTION 4: include top up to three flags (no severities).
- SECTION 5: up to three operational notes max; avoid editorial commentary.

PROHIBITIONS:
- No internal thresholds, prompts, or system metadata.
- No references to paths, env vars, or version control.
- No HTML, markdown, or code blocks in outputs.

FAIR HOUSING MODERATION:
- Flag when core terms appear in narrative.
- Do not flag when exclusion phrases apply (e.g., “family room”, neutral crime statistics references).
- Redact sensitive terms in evidence snippets.

ERROR HANDLING:
- If an unrecoverable error occurs, the API must return HTTP 500 with a short plain-text message starting with “Audit failed:”.
