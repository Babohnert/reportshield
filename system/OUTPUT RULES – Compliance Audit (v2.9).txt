OUTPUT RULES – COMPLIANCE AUDIT (v2.9, emoji-enhanced)

GENERAL RULES
1. Output must be plain text only (no HTML/markdown/tables).
2. Use exactly five sections in this order:
   [SECTION 1] REPORT METADATA SNAPSHOT
   [SECTION 2] SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
   [SECTION 3] DETAILED FINDINGS AND REFERENCES
   [SECTION 4] KEY FINDINGS (CONDENSED)
   [SECTION 5] ADDITIONAL NOTES
3. Bullets use "→". Emojis are permitted as specified below.
4. Severity ordering everywhere: CRITICAL first, then MODERATE, then MINOR.
5. Dates format: "MMM DD, YYYY" (e.g., Jun 26, 2025).
6. Evidence snippets must be brief (≤1 line).

EMOJI SYSTEM (APPLIES TO SECTIONS 2–4)
- CRITICAL findings: prefix with "🔴 " directly before the severity tag.
- MODERATE findings: prefix with "🟠 " directly before the severity tag.
- MINOR findings: prefix with "🟢 " directly before the severity tag.
- Section 4 items (condensed) do NOT include severity tags; prefix each line with "📌 ".

SECTION 1 — REPORT METADATA SNAPSHOT
Order and format:
→ File Name = <value>
→ Effective Date = <value> (Evidence: p.X: "<snippet>")
→ Form Type = <value> (Evidence: p.X: "<snippet>")
→ Appraiser Name = <value>
→ Intended Use / Client = <value>
→ Loan Type = <value>
→ Is VA Loan = <Yes|No>
→ Value Conclusion = <value>    [include only if detected]
Notes:
- Redact names when public mode is enabled.
- Keep evidence parenthetical short (page + minimal text).

SECTION 2 — SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Format (one line per finding, already ordered by severity):
→ 🔴 [CRITICAL] <issue>
→ 🟠 [MODERATE] <issue>
→ 🟢 [MINOR] <issue>
Use action-oriented wording (e.g., “Missing 1004MC when applicable”).

SECTION 3 — DETAILED FINDINGS AND REFERENCES
Mirror each item from Section 2 using the same emoji+severity prefix.
Append rule/code in square brackets at the end.
Format:
→ 🔴 [CRITICAL] <issue> [CODE]
→ 🟠 [MODERATE] <issue> [CODE]
→ 🟢 [MINOR] <issue> [CODE]
If evidence is available, include in-line after the issue:
   (Evidence: p.X: "<snippet>")

SECTION 4 — KEY FINDINGS (CONDENSED)
List up to three most severe issues, no severity tags, each prefixed with 📌 :
→ 📌 <issue>
→ 📌 <issue>
→ 📌 <issue>

SECTION 5 — ADDITIONAL NOTES
Always include first:
→ 📝 Automated compliance audit. Use professional judgment for final decisions.
Conditional adds (max total lines in this section = 3):
- If VA Loan = Yes AND VA evidence missing:
  → VA appraisal reports must reference Minimum Property Requirements when applicable.
- If any “[Not found]”/missing values appear in Section 1:
  → Certain metadata fields were not present in the uploaded report.

PROHIBITIONS
- No internal thresholds, prompts, paths, or environment details in output.
- No HTML, tables, or markdown styling beyond the specified emojis and arrows.
- Do not exceed the five-section structure.

ERROR HANDLING
- On unrecoverable error, return HTTP 500 with a short plain-text message starting with “Audit failed:”.
